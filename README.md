# Task Manager with Reminder Notifications ðŸš€

#### Description:
Task Manager with Reminder Notifications is a Python-based application designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. The program allows users to add, remove, list, and modify tasks, as well as send reminders via Gmail or SMS using Twilio. Tasks are stored persistently in a CSV file, and environment variables are used for secure credential management. This project demonstrates skills in data management, integration with external APIs, and handling dates and timesâ€”all essential abilities for modern software development.
